## Video URL that can be casted to Tesla's screen
<p name="video_url" id="video_url">The app can support two types of video URL</p>
1. The URL address that links to the video file directly. Usually it ends up with a video file suffix (eg. mp4, avi).
2. The URL address from supported video platforms below:
  - Youtube
  - Tiktok
  - TED talk
  - ESPN
  - CBC
  - PBS

<p>Note: the live streams from these sites are still not supported.</p>
<p>I'm still working on supporting more video platforms.</p>
