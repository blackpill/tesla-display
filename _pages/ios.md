## Will it spend extra internet traffic?
No, because your Tesla is connected to the hotspot wifi of your mobile phone, the screen data is transfered through the local wifi. 

## Why the screen stops while driving?
<p><span style="color: red"><b>IMPORTANT!!!</b></span>If you cannot use while driving, you should check the option "Remain connected in Drive" in the WiFi setting dialog on Tesla's screen.</p>
