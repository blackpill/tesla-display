If you are an Uber driver driving a Tesla, it is not safe to use the Uber Driver app while driving. This article will show you how to mirror your phone screen to Tesla's big touchscreen.

## 1. Install the app

## 2. Enable the WiFi hotspot of your phone
<p>We must enable the Wi-Fi hotspot becuase we use is to transfer data between the phone and the Tesla EV.
Then make sure that the Tesla EV is connected to the Wi-Fi hotspot of your phone.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><b>IMPORTANT!!!</b></span> The option "Remain connected in Drive" must be checked.</p>

</p>
Open the Tesla Display app, and click the setting tab.
It's strongly recommended to set the "Control on touchscreen" option checked. When it is checked, we can manipulate the Uber app directly on Tesla's touchscreen.
## 4. Mirror to Tesla's touchscreen

</p>
After setting, click the start button of Tesla Display. Choose "Phone screen when driving". After a moment, the phone screen starts mirroring.
Then open the web browser of Tesla EV, access the URL <span style="color:blue">https://td9.cc:7777</span>. Now we can see the phone screen in the web browser.
## 5. Open the Uber app
Now, we open the Uber app in the phone, and we can see the Uber app is casted to Tesla's touchscreen.
## 6. About the sound
Make sure that the Bluetooth is enabled in the phone and connected to the Tesla EV.
Set the sound source of Tesla to Bluetooth.
Then we can hear the alert sound of Uber from Tesla's speakers.
