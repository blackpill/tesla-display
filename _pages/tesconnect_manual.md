**Manual**

TesConnect can help you connect your WireGuard node wherever you are. More than a WireGuard client, it can help your find your services on your node, for example, your Web server on your node. Consequently, you can access your services directly using this app.

**Future**

It will support more VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN.

**Important Notes**

TesConnect is only a client tool. It doesn't provide any VPN services.
