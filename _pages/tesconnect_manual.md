**Audio**

Phone audio can be tranferred via Bluetooth.

**Video apps can be mirrored**

Due to DRM limits, some video apps cannot be mirrored to Telsa's screen.
Based on our test, the following iOS video apps can be mirrored.
The app list will keep updating.

- Youtube
- Youtube Kids
- Tiktok
- DailyMotion
- Plex
- Twitch
- PBS
- PBS Kids
- TED Talks
- Khan Academy
- Rumble
- Vimeo


**Other notes**

1. Don't lock your phone screen while casting, otherwise the service will stop.
2. Don't switch to other apps while casting video, otherwise the service will stop.
3. Currently, only MP4 video format is supported. Video files should be "Saved to Files" before casting.

**Future features**

1. Support playing video in Tesla's full-screen mode with audio
2. Support playlist
3. Support play audio only for Youtube video
4. Support more video formats
5. Support more video sites
