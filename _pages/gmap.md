## 1. Preparation
All we need is an Android phone.
Install the Tesla Display app from Google Play.

</p>

## 2. Enable the WiFi hotspot in your phone
We must enable the Wi-Fi hotspot becuase we use is to transfer data between the phone and the Tesla EV.
Then make sure that the Tesla EV is connected to the Wi-Fi hotspot of your phone.
## 3. Config in the Tesla Display app

</p>
Open the Tesla Display app, and click the setting tab.
We must set the "Mirror Mode" option to "Image Mode" because only "Image Mode" can work while Tesla is in driving mode.
It's strongly recommended to set the "Enable remote control" option checked. When it is checked, we can manipulate the Google Map app directly on Tesla's touchscreen.
## 4. Mirror to Tesla's touchscreen

After setting, click the start button of Tesla Display. Choose "Phone screen". After a moment, the phone screen starts mirroring.
Then open the web browser of Tesla EV, access the URL "https://td9.cc:7777". Now we can see the phone screen in the web browser.
## 5. Using the Google Map app

Now, we open the Google Map app in the phone, and we can see the Google Map app is casted to Tesla's touchscreen.
Then we can set the destination in the Google Map app.
## 6. About the sound
Make sure that the Bluetooth is enabled in the phone and connected to the Tesla EV.
Set the sound source of Tesla to Bluetooth.
Then we can hear the alert sound of Google Map from Tesla's speakers.
