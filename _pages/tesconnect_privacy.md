**Privacy Policy**

TCool LTD built the TesDisplay app as a free app with in-app purchase. This SERVICE is provided by TCool LTD at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at TesDisplay unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Data Collection and Usage**

TesDisplay does not collect or retain any personal information or data from its users. We are committed to maintaining a zero-data retention policy. We do not store, record, or monitor any user activity on our servers.

**Data Transmission**

TesDisplay is designed to provide you with a secure and private internet connection. The app does not send your data to our servers. Instead, it allows you to connect to your own VPN servers or a VPN service of your choice. Data transmission and storage are solely the responsibility of your selected VPN service. Please review the privacy policy of your chosen VPN provider to understand their data handling practices.

**Security**

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. We encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2023-10-20
