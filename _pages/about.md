## Why should I use this app?

1. Play some video files for passengers (eg. kids) to ease the pain of long trip.

2. Share personal videos or use some video apps that is not installed in Tesla.

3. In some countries(eg. China), Tesla's built-in navigator app is not good. We can use the mobile navigator app, and cast to Tesla's big screen.
