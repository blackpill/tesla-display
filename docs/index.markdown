# Tesla Display - An App for Tesla Drivers

This app can cast the small screen of your mobile phone to the big screen of your Tesla.

## Usecase 1:
Your kids can watch videos when you are driving.

## Usecase 2:
In some countries(eg. China), Tesla's built-in navigation app is not good. You can use the mobile navigation app, and cast the screen.

# Will it spend extra internet traffic?

No, because your Tesla is connected to the hotspot wifi of your mobile phone, the screen data is transfered through the local wifi. 

# How to improve the video quality?

1. Make sure that the hotspot wifi works in 5GHz mode.
2. Make sure that no other devices connect to the hotspot.
3. Disable hardware acceleration in the settings panel.
4. Resize image to a smaller ratio.

# Is this app free?

Yes. Only with some advertisement to support the author.
