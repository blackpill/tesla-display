## Use scenario 1:
Let your passengers(eg. your kids) watch interesting videos while you drive.

## Use scenario 2:
In some countries(eg. China), Tesla's built-in navigation app is not good. You can use the mobile navigation app, and cast the screen.

# Will it spend extra internet traffic?

No, because your Tesla is connected to the hotspot wifi of your mobile phone, the screen data is transfered through the local wifi. 

# How to improve the video quality?

1. Make sure that the hotspot wifi works in 5GHz mode.
2. Make sure that no other devices connected to the hotspot.
3. Resize image to a smaller ratio.
4. Adjust the max bitrate when working in video mode.

# Does it support full-screen mode in Tesla?
Yes. First enter the full-screen mode via https://www.fullscreentesla.com or http://s3xy.top in Tesla's browser, and then add a link to http://7.7.7.7:7777.

# What type of video URL address this app can support?
<p name="video_url" id="video_url">The app can support two types of video URL</p>
1. The URL address that links to the video file directly. Usually it ends up with a video file suffix (eg. mp4, avi).
2. The URL address from supported video platforms below:
  - Youtube
  - Tiktok
  - TED talk
  - ESPN
  - CBC
  - PBS

<p>Note: the live streams from these sites are still not supported.</p>
<p>I'm still working on supporting more video platforms.</p>
